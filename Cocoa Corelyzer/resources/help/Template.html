This site is a ContentCreationWiki whose focus is PeopleProjectsAndPatterns in SoftwareDevelopment.
The ideas of "Wiki" may seem strange at first, but dive in and explore its links. "Wiki" is a composition system; it's a discussion medium; it's a repository; it's a mail system; it's a tool for collaboration. Really, we don't know quite what it is, but it's a fun way of communicating asynchronously across the network.
The name "Wiki" is strange too - what does it mean? The WikiWikiWebFaq answers this and other questions, but the short answer is that "WikiWiki" is Hawaiian for "quick".
